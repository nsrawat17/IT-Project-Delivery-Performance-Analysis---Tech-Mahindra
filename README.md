🚀 Tech Mahindra – IT Project Delivery Performance Anslysis and Dashboard
This project is an interactive and visually compelling IT Project Delivery Performance Dashboard built using Power BI Desktop. It analyzes project delivery timelines, cost overruns, and technology stack efficiency to assess the effectiveness of project execution across Tech Mahindra's IT initiatives.

The project is divided into two key phases:
🔹 1. Data Analysis using Python
- At the initial stage, Python was used to perform:
- Data import, inspection, and cleaning using Pandas
- Handling of missing or inconsistent data
- Feature engineering (e.g., cost overrun calculation, delay status flag)
- Preparation of a clean dataset for visualization

This ensured that the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for reporting in Power BI.

🔹 2. Dashboard Design using Power BI
- The Power BI dashboard was built to:
- Track project delivery status: Completed, In Progress, Delayed
- Identify trends in cost overruns and delay patterns
-Analyze the performance of different technology stacks (Java, React, SAP, etc.)
- Understand the effect of team size on delivery cost and efficiency
- Enable decision-makers to explore KPIs using filters and slicers

This combined approach creates a robust and insightful view of project performance across the organization.
  
🧪 Python-Based Data Preparation (Initial Phase)
At the beginning of the project, I used Python exclusively for data cleaning and preparation.
No visualizations were created during this stage.
The goal was to ensure high data quality before importing into Power BI.

Key Python Tasks Performed:
1. Imported the raw dataset using Pandas
2. Checked and handled missing values
3. Standardized date formats and calculated project duration
4. Created new columns (e.g., Cost Overrun, Delay Status)
5. Exported the cleaned dataset as a CSV for Power BI visualization
6. This step laid the foundation for accurate, meaningful dashboards.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Power BI Desktop
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – for data cleaning and transformation
- Power Query Editor
- Custom Visuals & KPI Cards
- Filters, Slicers, and Drilldowns

📈 Key Features

1. Average Cost Overrun: ₹28.12K
2. Total Project Budget: ₹32M
3. Project Delay Percentage: 32%
4. Technology Stack: 8 technologies analyzed (Java, React, Python, .NET, etc.)
5. Status Distribution: Delayed, Completed, and In Progress projects
6. Avg. Cost Overrun vs Team Size chart

🔍 Dashboard Insights

1. Java-based projects have the highest delay rates, while SAP and Node.js projects are more timely
2. Delayed projects are the largest category, indicating delivery inefficiencies
3. Larger teams tend to show higher average cost overruns, suggesting that bigger isn't always better
4. Most commonly used technologies: Java, React, Salesforce

🧠 Learnings

1. Strengthened understanding of data cleaning workflows in Python
2. Learned to structure datasets for smooth Power BI integration
3. Gained practical experience in executive-level dashboard design
4. Understood real-world delivery metrics like delay %, cost overrun, and tech stack influence
